            <p>My name is Hyejin Kim and I'm live in Los Angeles. I'm currenty working in different field but I'm interested in Web Developing field. I really want to hard to understand and to learn a lot about coding!</p>
            <p>I personally think that the coding is one of the great artwork that we can create and release to audiences. Any image that we created in head can draw by using htmls and csss, beside of paints and blushes. </p>
            <p>I'm so excited to be here in class and want to learn a lot even though I'm shy and not that active woman. </p>
